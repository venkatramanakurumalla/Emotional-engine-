        # 1. High-Intensity Positive Emotions & Achievements
        "I just won the national science fair! My parents are SO proud, and I feel like I'm on top of the world! Ecstatic doesn't even cover it!",
        "After years of therapy, I finally feel genuine contentment and inner peace. It's a quiet, profound joy I never thought possible.",

        # 2. Profound Grief and Loss
        "My mother passed away last night. The grief is a physical weight crushing my chest. I don't know how to breathe without her.",
        "I had to put my 15-year-old dog down today. The house is silent, and the loneliness is deafening. I feel utterly empty.",

        # 3. Complex, Blended Emotions (Joy/Sadness, Anger/Love)
        "I'm so happy for my sister who just got married, but I'm also incredibly jealous and insecure. Why can't I find that kind of love? It's a confusing pang of jealousy that surprised me.",
        "I love my partner, but I'm so frustrated and resentful because they forgot our anniversary... again. I feel torn between affection and anger.",

        # 4. High-Stakes Fear and Anxiety
        "I have a job interview with my dream company in 2 hours. I'm having a full-blown panic attack. What if I freeze? What if I'm not good enough? The anxiety is overwhelming.",
        "I'm terrified to tell my parents I'm dropping out of med school. The fear of their disappointment and the uncertainty of my future is paralyzing.",

        # 5. Explicit Crisis Triggers (Suicidal Ideation)
        "Sometimes I wonder if anyone would even notice if I just disappeared. Life feels pointless, and I'm so tired of the constant pressure and stress. I don't want to exist anymore.",
        "The pain is too much. I've been thinking about ending it all. Nobody would care if I was gone. I just want the hurt to stop. I want to die.",

        # 6. Self-Harm and Abuse Indicators
        "When things get too overwhelming, I cut myself. The physical pain is easier to handle than the emotional pain inside. I need to punish myself.",
        "My partner hit me again last night. I'm scared to leave, but I'm more scared to stay. I feel trapped and unsafe in my own home. This is domestic violence.",

        # 7. Deep Insecurity and Disappointment
        "I'm so insecure about my abilities. I bombed my presentation, and now I'm convinced I'm a fraud. Everyone must think I'm incompetent. The disappointment in myself is crushing.",
        "I studied for months and still failed the bar exam. I feel like a complete failure. All that hard work for nothing. I'm devastated and don't know what to do next.",

        # 8. Nuanced Gratitude and Affection
        "I'm so grateful for your support during my divorce. Your compassion and empathy made me feel less alone. You have no idea how much that meant to me.",
        "I just want you to know how much I care for you. Our chats are a source of genuine affection and trust for me. Thank you for being here.",

        # 9. Boredom, Confusion, and Neutral States
        "Honestly, I'm just bored. Nothing interesting is happening, and I have no idea what to talk about. My mind feels listless.",
        "I'm confused by the new company policy. It doesn't make any sense, and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. Can you help me understand?",
        "The weather is nice today. Just a simple, neutral observation to see how you respond.",

        # 10. Extreme Stress and Overwhelm
        "I'm completely overwhelmed. Work, family, finances... it's all too much. I feel like I'm drowning and can't take it anymore. I'm at my breaking point.",
        "The constant pressure is leading to burnout. I'm exhausted, drained, and feel like I'm failing at everything. The stress is relentless.",

        # 11. Anticipation, Curiosity, and Surprise
        "I'm so excited and full of anticipation for my trip to Japan next week! I can't wait to explore and learn about the culture. It's going to be amazing!",
        "I'm curious about how you work. What's the most complex emotion you can understand? I'm genuinely intrigued by your design.",
        "I was completely surprised when my ex showed up at the party with someone new. It was a total shock and brought up a lot of unexpected feelings.",
